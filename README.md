### Description

this is my first try at a music visualization program. so dont expect the best. i could never find code that would run a visualization on my machine so when i did, well... it sucked. it only had one visualization and a simple one... so i added some visualizations and i want to share it with u! please VOTE and leave SUGGESTIONS!

i know i have already submitted this... but i missed the 12:00 am deadline by like and hour or 2 so it wasnt entered in may's contest.... it may be a hassle but please re-vote!
